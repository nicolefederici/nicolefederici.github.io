<h3 class="p1"><strong>“Why did you decide to learn software development?”</strong></h3>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 16px;"> I needed a new medium </span><span class="s1" style="font-size: 16px;">to get me closer to the ideas. </span></h3>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 16px;"> </span></h3>

<p class="p3">Ideally, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/01/arts/01iht-DESIGN1.html" target="_blank">our content should choose its media</a>, even if our media then enables new planes of creativity. Instead, we tend to focus on the delivery technique itself, and the long struggle to master it. But real drive is more like murky obsession— it’s hard to know much about it at the time, and that may be its best design feature. We still need drive and grit, but software engineering allows us to put more of that energy into the development and strategic execution of our ideas.</p>

<h3 class="p3"><strong><span class="s1">LARPing</span></strong></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Given my pre-teen start in it, the fact that my first <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZXY6SVs3-4" target="_blank">profession/medium </a> (Go Giants!) could be described as elaborate <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/03/perchance-to-dream-larping-hamlet-at-the-real-castle-elsinore/387025/" target="_blank">LARPing</a> </span><span class="s1">makes sense. I had no idea what I was getting into. I could tell you why I <i>thought</i> I chose it back then. Instead, let me share a blood-maxim:</span></p>

<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Professions that require children to make life-long Faustian deals are kind of a racket. Be suspicious of them. </span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The point is, I don’t think our most visceral motivations change that much over time; it’s only just now that I understand the ones I made at twelve. I'm not saying that <i>all</i> artists operate only in a dream world, and anyway, we need our hardcore imaginers. But I <em>am</em> saying that the particular way in which I’ve come to value experimentation, ideas, community, and innovation requires me to change mediums at this moment, so I can participate more directly in our community today. I'd like to design systems and infrastructures that promote artistry as a quality of life requirement, not only as a quality reserved for specialists and the wealthy. I’m aiming for street slang level flexibility, a jazz feature that will always be current. And for the love of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXtEBYuB9zE" target="_blank">Grace Hopper</a>, I’m asking technology to include new perspectives.</span></p>

<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Process and a New Lab</b></span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The moment a thought bubbles up from a gut feeling, I can’t help but give it a good test thwack for honesty. If that doesn’t take it down, I detonate (and repeat as needed until rubble). I try to keep all hope out of these procedures, so what’s left might be useable, i.e., “true”. This creative approach also turns out to be an excellent process for coding; Algorithms seem to be the basic design of thinking.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>If you're limiting your experiments to protect the lab, it's time for a new lab.</strong> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">New problems demand the invention of new methods — it’s where they come from. Unusual combinations in perspective promote healthy abstraction, and this works both ways like a creative engine. In coding, the more abstracted a method, the more concentrated and useful it becomes. If you doubt me, consider the blues.</span></p>

<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Virtual Reality</b></span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">It’s no coincidence that as former professions become the practical equivalent of Live Action Role Play, we’re seeing the rise of accessible Virtual Reality technology. The abstract idea is that in a realm so arcane, so meticulously simulated, one is safe to try anything until it's street ready.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-357" src="https://nicolefederici.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/kbdv2cp1i9olh2e2i.gif" alt="kbdv2cp1i9olh2e2i" width="450" height="188" /></p>
It sounds almost right, if you do eventually get out onto the street. It's fun, and fun is important. But all on its own, it's missing something.  You absolutely need the the highest stakes, or you miss the exhilaration of it; everybody misses it, and no one gambles right. Oh yeah, and by the time the training is thought to be over, you've usually lost touch with the street anyway.
<p class="p3">In a VR situation, you feel risk,</p>
<p class="p3"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-358" src="https://nicolefederici.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/l3ucefaihwxpdfeba.gif" alt="l3ucefaihwxpdfeba" width="480" height="252" /></p>
&nbsp;
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">but it's like the cushioned risk you feel around family. I think if you feel that way, it’s time to get out where you are truly terrified to experiment, because that's where it will matter most. Wherever you feel that— you’re in the right place. I decided to learn software development so I could speak the language of <i>that</i> place as I see it at the moment. That stuff I got from unconscious LARPing is worth holding on to though, and I plan to keep it right out front. "We are Family" and all that.</span></p>
<p class="p3">Still, assuming we’re aiming for new ideas, we could all stand to Play and Interact more, with real risk, that is. Civil War re-enactors, deep-cover cats who still say “you dig?”, or virtuoso lute players in empire-waisted hemp skirts do have something crucial to offer, believe me. And it’s more than how to decline Latin nouns or that  <a href="http://thedreamstress.com/2014/08/terminology-whats-the-difference-between-worsted-woollen-wool-fabrics/" target="_blank">"worsted"</a> wool used to be “washed in urine", or that old ladies on the Isle of Skye sang work songs about lovemaking that were passed down for generations so they could stand to worst that wool in order to keep warm. (the fact that I even know about that is both the Smithsonian’s and Alan Lomax’s fault)  It's a message about the value of artistry, imagination, and shared experience in a moment.  Unfortunately, this message often hides in back alleys and sub-cultures. I'm hoping we can do something about that.</p>

<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>A<i> Last Show </i>Mentality</b></span></h3>
<p class="p3">The innovators I admire are multi-lingual improvisers who thrive at the chaos points. My favorite thing <strong><a href="https://louisck.net/" target="_blank">Louis CK</a></strong> ever said during a set was,</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">“How do you think I feel? It’s my last show, probably.”</span></p>
<p class="p3">You can see where and why here:</p>

<p class="p3"><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Hempel">Amy Hempel</a></strong>, a former stand-up, is more well known as someone who can write a story like no one else.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <a href="http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/227/the-art-of-fiction-no-176-amy-hempel" target="_blank">She rememb</a></span><a href="http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/227/the-art-of-fiction-no-176-amy-hempel" target="_blank">ers her first writing class</a> with Gordon Lish at Columbia:</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Vividly. The assignment was to write our worst secret, the thing we would never live down, the thing that, as Gordon put it, “dismantles your own sense of yourself.” And everybody knew instantly what that thing, for them, was. We found out immediately that the stakes were very high, that we were expected to say something no one else had said, and to divulge much harder truths than we had ever told or ever thought to tell. No half-measures. He thought any of us could do it if we wanted it badly enough. And that, when I was starting out, was a great thing to hear from someone who would know.</span></p>

<p class="p3"><strong><a href="http://conduction.us/" target="_blank">Butch Morris</a></strong> is a composer, improviser, and conductor who invented a “compiler” technique called Conduction®. It's a hand-signaled language that allows musicians and artists from all genres to improvise together. Lots of composers tried versions of this idea before him, but no one succeeded in creating such a nuanced, coherent, and flexibly structured multi-genre performance experience like he did. As an artist, he never left the street, out where people use things and talk with each other in real languages. He could talk to anyone. He dealt with a lot of rejection at first, and often spoke about how whole orchestras walked out on him in rehearsal when he started out. He hated solos. He loved contributions. His lab allowed for the freedom to offend and incorporated chaos.</p>
<p class="p3"> Here's some music from one the last shows he gave before he died.</p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">But he always played like it was the very last time. I know this, because I played in his bands for many years. In fact, I’m playing here, out front, on the far left.</span></p>
