<p class="p2"><em>This interview and short series is a collaboration between Nicole Federici and Adam Cooper</em></p>
<p class="p2">From Tom Stoppard’s <i>Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead:</i></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><i>Act One</i></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Two ELIZABETHANS passing time in a place without any visible character. They are well-dressed - hats, cloaks, </span><span class="s1">sticks and all. Each of them has a large leather money bag. Guildenstern's bag is nearly empty. Rosencrantz's bag </span><span class="s1">is nearly full. The reason being: they are betting on the toss of a coin, in the following manner: Guildenstern </span><span class="s1">(hereafter 'GUIL') takes a coin out of his bag, spins it, letting it fall. Rosencrantz (hereafter 'ROS') studies it, </span><span class="s1">announces it as "heads" (as it happens) and puts it into his own bag. Then they repeat the process. They have </span><span class="s1">apparently been doing it for some time. The run of "heads" is impossible, yet ROS betrays no surprise at all -</span><span class="s1">he feels none. However he is nice enough to feel a little embarrassed at taking so much money off his friend. Let </span><span class="s1">that be his character note. GUIL is well alive to the oddity of it. He is not worried about the money, but he is </span><span class="s1">worried by the implications ; aware but not going to panic about it - his character note. </span><span class="s1">GUIL sits. ROS stands (he does the moving, retrieving coins). </span><span class="s1">GUIL spins. ROS studies coin.</span></p>

<h2 class="p2">Epicenter of the Brooklyn Tech Scene ;)</h2>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Adam Cooper and Nicole Federici are typing on laptops at a kitchen table covered with papers in the last un-hip area of Bushwick, Brooklyn. It’s the<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Summer of 2016. Nicole is working through the Flatiron School’s full-stack course, and Adam is training himself in impromptu algorithmic production. Adam wears a hoodie, Nicole doesn’t.</span></p>


<hr />
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">NF: Hey, what are you doing?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">AC: Im figuring out which data structure is my favorite to select random elements from. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">NF: Cool. …nail that down…might become handy.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">So how are you going to make these random numbers? And while you’re at it, can you tell me what makes a number random? (Nicole had not yet used Math.random)</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">AC: I’m gonna use Math.random()</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">NF: What’s Math dot random? How can math give us randomness? It’s math!</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">AC: It’s not random-random. It’s pseudorandom. Because you’re right: math can’t give us random.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">NF: Is π random then? Not the π digits we know about, but the π we don’t know yet? The π that’s way way out there? Is that random…since we can’t predict it?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">AC: Probably not…as our measurement tools improve we always seem to keep predicting accurately.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">NF: I was wondering whether randomness was a “it hasn’t been born yet” kind of thing, like, “we don’t know who it is yet &amp; can’t predict it yet”.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">AC: Well, I think we will be able to predict it.</span></p>


<hr />
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">At this point, they did a slew of athletic googling on the nature of randomness which led them to a near-impenetrable treatise put out by some important mathmakers at Stanford. Finally, they called upon their friend Peter, the science mentor they kidnapped, to shed some light on the matter. They were hoping he’d get Stockholm Syndrome. (the coffee took place in a Fika, so that’s a start.) </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Old World precision, even (and especially) in the face of these “IANAStatistician/LOL” times, is the kind of valor they had come to expect from Peter. He came prepared with a crisp, two-page handout detailing his answers to their questions. After a bit of feeble follow-up on their part, he proceeded to hold forth on Western swing and other fun topics related neither to randomness nor each other. To give you a taste of the breadth we’re talking about here, they met Peter while participating in a reading of <i>Richard III</i> that he and his friend Guan put together and continue to host every month (the Shakespeare play changes, of course) Without further ado, here’s the two-page handout. They provided him with a few pre-interview-question guidelines, which he included above his answers. Their comments will follow, because they needed time to digest and research his responses.</span></p>

<h2 class="p2">"The Handout", by Peter</h2>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">NF/AC: What is randomness?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">PS: </span><span class="s3">The best I can come up wit</span><span class="s1">h is “inherently unpredictable”. That is, a list of results generated by a process whose next result cannot be predicted; to be distinguished from one which could be predicted, but we don’t happen to know how.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">NF/AC: Is it the same as indeterminacy?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">PS: “Indeterminacy” is used in several ways as a technical term, as far as I can see. (a) In one sense of the term, there’s a linguistic difference only: An indeterminate process produces random results. So this is true of quantum indeterminacy, the result of an indeterminate process: Opening <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/03/books/review/einsteins-dice-and-schrodingers-cat-by-paul-halpern.html?mtrref=duckduckgo.com&amp;gwh=8EA26695532D09A5D6F1FB2C16A0E9A5&amp;gwt=pay" target="_blank">Schrödinger’s box reveals a cat</a> that is alive half the time and dead half the time, but you can’t predict which it will be. So that is an indeterminate process. (b) In computation, the term is sometimes applied to situations like race conditions in concurrent processes, and in this sense it is<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>usually a bug. The results of such a process may depend on more than the explicit inputs; for example, if the computer has several processors, it might depend on how busy the processors are. In this sense, it’s usually an undesirable property, but randomness, if it can be characterized by or generated according to some known distribution, is a highly desirable thing to be able to generate. (c) In a<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>computer language standard, “indeterminate” can mean unspecified, I think. Like, in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)#K.26R_C" target="_blank">K&amp;R C</a>, what happens if you pass a float to a function that expects an int, or even in later versions, what happens if you attempt to divide by zero? (In the latter case, if <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5976968/?reload=true" target="_blank">IEEE arithmetic</a> is in force, there is a specified behavior.) It’s been a long time since I’ve been up on the C standard, so these examples may not be exactly correct. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">NF/AC: Why is it important?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">PS: For <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method" target="_blank">Monte Carlo</a> simulations, for example, such as simulation of the performance of a stock portfolio, or simulating how molecules will behave at temperatures above absolute zero, where the effect of temperature is to transfer heat, which, on the microscopic level, </span><span class="s1">translates to a random kinetic energy of some average magnitude. On the fundamental physical level, heat is random motion, and the degree of indeterminacy (randomness) in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_process" target="_blank">quantum processes</a> can be quantified, so we can say exactly what we expect by performing a sequence of experiments, which can provide a test of the theory.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">NF/AC: If we can’t actually have it, how do we construct pseudo random numbers—what do we need from them? What are they good for?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">PS: Many methods. Simplest is “linear congruential”, where “I[j+1] = (a&#42;I[j]) % m”. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator" target="_blank">Wikipedia gives the conditions</a> on a and m, but a common choice is a=7&#42;&#42;5, m=2&#42;&#42;31 -1. You start with some number for I[0], and use it to generate I[1], and so on. I[0] (“the seed”) is often taken from the Unix time.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">NF/AC: You were talking about the decay of radioactive substances; can you go into that?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">PS: The time between successive decay events in a sample of radioactive material is random. If on average, there is one decay per second, it doesn’t go like clockwork, exactly once a second. Rather, one second is only the *average* time between decays. Sometimes the interval is shorter, sometimes longer. I forget what distribution this gives.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">NF/AC: Is π thought of as random? (which seems really strange considering what it comes from)</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">PS: The value of pi isn’t random, but the sequence of digits is (or is believed to be) random. That is, given some list of digits from somewhere in the middle of pi’s sequence of digits it’s not, in general, possible to predict the next one, and in general, in base 10, we would expect each digit to occur 1/10 of the time, each possible adjacent pair to occur 1/100 of the time, and so on. This implies not just randomness, but a uniform distribution of digits and an independence of each digit from the previous digits. Of course, if we start out knowing they’re the digits of pi, and have the entire sequence of digits so far, a big enough computer will allow you to predict the next one from any truncation point. So in that sense, it’s not random. But OTOH, if the digits are random, you can say that the complete works of Shakespeare (and of everyone else) will be found an infinite number of times in the sequence.</span></p>

<p class="p3"><em><span class="s1">In his own words, Peter Shenkin is a computational chemist with experience(!) in software product design and implementation who formally “retired” in January, 2016. But there is so much more to say. He’s the kind of guy you feel like you should always call professor, in the same way you would always call <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qB76jxBq_gQ" target="_blank">Glenn Gould</a> maestro: charmingly and dead seriously at the same time. He retired after three years as a Fellow at Schrödinger, Inc., where he had already held the post of Vice President of Software Development for over 13 years. Before that, he was a research scientist for a little 6 year stint at Columbia University, and before that, he was an Assistant Professor of Chemistry at Barnard College for 5 years. Prior to this youth guidance, and because he wanted to “try something different after graduate school”, he joined Owens Corning Fiberglass’ Exploratory Research Department where he helped develop all sorts of new technologies. “…And that was how I became an asphalt expert.”, he said, reassuringly, as he pushed the eject button of his Aston Martin. </span></em></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><em>On top of all that, he can talk to you about protein folding like it’s some kind of mixed martial arts meets wingsuited space travel. He got both of us into <a href="http://folding.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">Folding@home</a>, before it was cool, and before the idea appeared in any hip Herzog movie. Check it out! He even worked on <a href="http://www.bfi.org/about-fuller/big-ideas/world-game" target="_blank">Buckminster Fuller’s World Game Project</a>, a proto-crowdsourced, world-problem-solving, collaborative effort involving some visionary thinking that's still  visionary today. On the side, he can talk music like a pro and loves to play his geetar. He sent us this sweet tune (sweet violin solo) as a coda to our chat on randomness.</em> </span></p>
