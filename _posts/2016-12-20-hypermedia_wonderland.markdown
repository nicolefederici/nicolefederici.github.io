<strong>Desperados in a Crisis of Content</strong>

The crusade for self-delivering, GPS-locatable, flying friendship doughnuts has been distracting, but that wasn’t the internet’s fault. In so many fields, we were already tangled-up in a technical arms race of perfectionism and inane credentialing. We simply used the internet to do all the old chores  faster, cheaper, and with more robot. We didn't let the internet help us to develop better ideas, better content. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jun/22/charlie-chaplin-first-talkie-discovered" target="_blank">Even the great Charlie Chaplin's</a> mastery was so defined by specialized technique, he had trouble thinking  creatively in the earliest forms of multi-media; he felt old-fashioned.  So these technological transitions are a known recurring challenge. We can’t let our creativity get amputated in some drug-addled ritual of so-called-Progress. <a href="https://http.cat/406" target="_blank">406! </a>Our history isn't currently well served by our narrative products. I think we can begin to use web applications for more humanistic goals that were not previously accessible in old media forms. That’s the direction I’d like to move in.

<b>What is it?</b>

Our truest stories are always partially hidden inside forms that can't handle the depth and dimension of experience. We still haven't figured out how to create storage  and visualization for the elusive data of human memory, for example. If we were to truly include the idea of memory, we'd have to create an imperfectly  visible representation that decays in unpredictable, perhaps betraying ways.  That kind of thing can't be done on paper (yet?), at least as far as I can imagine. Hip-hop's global saturation  (and the scarcity of melody, now, as a result—and yes, I'm good with laying that at the feet of hip-hop) is proof that our narrative forms aren't serving our content properly.

<a href="https://github.com/nicolefederici/hypermedia_wonderland" target="_blank">Enter Hypermedia Wonderland:</a> the dynamic storytelling platform of my dreams (but still in primitive, prototype form). Long before I was able to code, I needed an instrument designed specifically to encourage multi-media expression and remote collaborative engagement. I didn’t want projects to be restricted by time, venue, or audience numbers. I imagined HW would accommodate the micro-depths and scenic routes of new story experiences. Although we’ve already had glimpses of this kind of disco-puzzle-artistic-participatory-reportage (narrative game development, digital literature, etc.), these motions aren’t yet native to our processes; we still think left to right.

In Shakespeare’s time, left to right quills were around for everyone with paper to write on. And as a result, lots of groovy left to right stuff got written. It wasn’t so much low-tech, as it was representative of the platforms of the day. But why not high-tech now? Throughout history, so much of what we called <em>Art</em> was craft glorified by excessive labor. That value system made some sense before faithful reproduction and recording technologies became mainstream. At some point, the cool kids mostly agreed that realism in painting wasn’t as compelling after photography emerged. That shift did A<em>rt</em> a huge favor, because it forced artists to deal in ideas. And thank God.

*Piss Christ* by Andres Serrano

Likewise, we should be telling a different kind of story now, one that comes from our fresh focus on novel content collections like beautifully ordered boutique data within unexpected delivery objects. Our new tools of literary production should let us crinkle together the layers of groovy with the un. The tech we use to imagine should reflect the tech we use to deliver; we should create new forms that are native to, and take best advantage of, these new technologies that allow art to seep into unexpected places in our daily lives. I’m hoping we might bend our cultural aspirations toward structures that are more inclusive, engaging, surprising, and as a result, more truly expressive of us in great detail. The surprise could force some refreshing sincerity into our everyday. God, I wish we’d committed to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smell-O-Vision" target="_blank">Smell-O-Vision</a> like we ought to have.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphor_in_philosophy" target="_blank"><strong>Juliet is the Sun</strong></a>

For my first project on HW, I decided to imagine a group of actors, designers, musicians, and dancers working up a new version of Romeo and Juliet. I called it <em>Juliet is the Sun</em> because that particular metaphor has felt slippery to philosophers, and because I thought it would be interesting to create a Juliet-centric, avant-gardish, abstract version of the story.

<strong>HW in Action</strong>

<strong>Artistic Thinking is for Everyone</strong>

Technology and art better "hug it out" soon, because we’re living in a time when the art needs to come find us. I don’t think it’s that we’re lazy—it’s just an emergency. We already know what seeps into <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=heaven%27s+gate+cult&atb=v17&ia=videos&iai=AqSZhwu1Rwo" target="_blank">the gaps where our culture and art should be</a>. As the way we tell stories becomes more improvisatory and intricate, admitting of new slangs and rowdier participation, we need to get the flexible collaborative tools for shaping these experiences into the hands of more people. Modular, narrative technologies need to be accessible, is the point, whatever one’s income. It’s like rock ’n’ roll again, baby.

Can we try to do away with snobbishness, and with that, the idea that some people are artistically minded and others aren’t? That’s like saying some people can appreciate air and others can’t. I get that people want their expensive qualifications to remain valuable as long as possible— that was the old way of thinking. But who we’ve listened to and why in that system was never much of an experiment. I think we should have the courage to let go of all that confinement. Better that we become artistic freedom-fighters: technologists and narrative DJs, mixing up beautiful communication experiences to inform everything we do. We’ve valued the wrong things: the layers of complexity in any personhood require a lifetime of collection- an inherent value that can’t be reproduced. What's the internet for, if not to bring those collections closer to one another?

<strong>Wheels Within Wheels</strong>

Yes, I’m writing this blogpost in a left to right fashion. That’s because HW is just a crude little prototype right now. I wanted to experience the basic movement of its simple levers, so I could plan for a more robust build in Rails and JavaScript. Its current build does offer networking, database persistance, and collaborative capabilities.

<em>(Conveniently, HW is also a functional CRUD application that uses Sinatra, Active Record, Git, and MVC architecture. I submitted it in partial fulfillment of the Full-Stack Web Development program’s requirements at <a href="https://flatironschool.com/about-us/" target="_blank">the Flatiron School.</a> )</em>

I’ll admit that I used HW to write this very blog post in left-to-right. It felt natural to think in single-idea pieces I couldn't lose the flavors of. I was able to store other media alongside ideas I might like to layer, and that was helpful too.

While writing thoughts for this blog-piece into HW, I was thinking about the design of this toolkit itself. I decided to use my little machine to put it through <a href="https://www.vitsoe.com/gb/about/good-design" target="_blank">Dieter Rams' ten principles for good design.</a> This process turned out to be a great way to store my thoughts on ideal UX, code-craft, and beauty with respect to HW. I’m not sure if I’d have thought about its design so thoroughly had I not used the platform itself to critique its usage. I enjoyed the media collage-storage feature that allowed me to take notes on visual, musical, and film designs I love, while including links to them right where I needed them. If I hadn’t been required to use SQLite, I’d have enjoyed soliciting others' comments on the design through the platform as well. Feel free to peruse my notes  and critique this project with respect to Dieter Rams' design principles; it will come inside the tin when you download the platform to try it out.

<strong>UX discoveries</strong>

One of the main things I’d like to change about HW as I move it into a more appropriate database structure with a snappier front-end experience, is the idea that we have to click to move from page to page. I’d rather take a single, giant page approach to projects, that can be zoomed into or away from. I’d prefer the pieces of composition to appear more dimensionally layered where they sit, so a user can move around and between them as easily as they might place a hat box on a shelf. I’d rather the platform feel like an infinitely stretchy room with logical places to store ideas, and the function to group and arrange them.

<strong>We Invent When We Must</strong>
I’d thought of creating this tool years ago, when I was coaching <a href="https://youtu.be/dqkZ8fB-h00" target="_blank">Sonic Smithy</a>, an improvisational music composition and performance group for kids. At the time, I didn’t know how to write programs, and I didn’t know anyone who could make what I’d imagined using. SS met only once a week for a few hours, so our rehearsal time was precious. This platform would have helped the kids “teach” one another their musical ideas more effectively before rehearsals, in whichever composition method worked best for the job. They could have commented throughout the week to one another. I could have used it to present teaching videos and recordings alongside films of various artists we worked with. In my professional band, I could have presented and even composed the score to my piece, “Ornithopter”, using HW’s graphic/sonic storage capabilities. Here is a recording of my band performing another graphic score I made in tribute to <a href="https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/all-whiskey-heaven" target="_blank">Charles Bernstein's poem of the same name:</a>

<iframe src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/37656704&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true" width="100%" height="450" frameborder="no" scrolling="no"></iframe>

"Ornithopter" presented technical complexities. It was an audio-score I’d built from various permutations of the Baltimore oriole’s calls in field recordings I’d borrowed with permission from the <a href="http://www.birds.cornell.edu/Page.aspx?pid=1478" target="_blank">Cornell Lab of Ornithology</a>. Each field clip was a linguistic signal I’d used to indicate a distinct musical action for the improvising band (example actions: suddenly stop, move up a half-step, repeat the motivic idea before the call, only play after another, play the opposite, etc…). Anyone in the group could assume direction at any point in a performance. Precise call reproduction through vibraphone, trumpet, drums, voice, and violin of the made-up bird-call-language by every member was essential to the piece. While totally cool to play and hear, "Ornithopter" posed a great time-burden on our rehearsals, one that led to our never recording that track. It was both a quasi-improv piece in its own right, and a layering piece used to comment on other works and structures of musical improv, like Hoagy Carmichael’s “Baltimore Oriole”, for example. It was my favorite tune of ours.

Sonic Smithy once collectively composed a marching tune with this (screamed) lyric,
<pre>“We.  need.  everybody’s help.  to make this cool tune. 
This is a crazy sound! [solo improv of one member] 
check it OUT! [more crazy soloing of that same member].”</pre>

I always thought those were great marching orders for anyone, really. That collaboration philosophy is what made me envision this platform in the first place. I may just load it up with Ornithopter, and invite you all out to play it with me.

<strong>Here are the technologies I used to create Hypermedia Wonderland:</strong>

Sinatra, Active Record, CSS3/HTML5, UX Mockup work-flow methodologies, Git, GitHub, Bash, Ruby, SQLite, Rake, RESTful routes, MVC architecture, bcrypt, data sanitization, protection against XSS attacks,and other non-coding knowledge of Shakespeare, Sun-Ra, Dieter Rams,improvisational music composition, straight-up ornithology, and graphic scores.

<strong>Some technical issues of interest I encountered while making it:</strong>

<strong>XSS</strong>

I knew I wanted to include some protection against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting" target="_blank">Cross Site Scripting</a> (XSS for short). The basic (about a 2 on a scale from zero to Snowden) code for this is pretty simple. In your application controller, include this:
<pre>require './config/environment'
include ERB::Util
#the second line here is a module to help sanitize for XSS</pre>
and then, use the “h” method on a view page, within the HTML tag meant to display web-copied data using ERB, like this: h(whatever’s gonna display in the browser). See below:
<pre class="oldchunk-text"><%= h(oldchunk.text).gsub(/\n/, '') %></pre>
Here is how it sanitizes: the h method, located inside the ERB::Util
module, takes special characters (like the angle brackets in tags)and converts them to their HTML code equivalents. So, if the browser sees

[<em>ok, I'm leaving this empty space here, because Wordpress just proved my point for me! It ate my example of sneaky, invasive malware code. Didn't leave a trace! So now we know. Nice job, Wordpress!</em>]

it will execute that malware! With the h method, the browser will see

“<” which tells it to display an angle bracket, rather than reading and executing its code. This stuffs the gun.

Sometimes, developers and Civil War reenactors overlap in a Venn diagram. It happens! In honor of that association, here is a tiny cyber war, as fought between the North and the South using only the the muskets of XSS.

<em>The Northern general sneakily posts a downloadable, high pixel count version of our constitution’s second amendment, hand-done in roundhand on theatrically “bloodied” parchment. Its maximum enlargement size is at least equivalent to that of the facade on most three-car-garages. When the Confederate soldier goes to the link providing a print-preview, a hidden script inside the html on that display page uses JavaScript to access that user’s IoT device that plays “Dixie” instead of the usual car horn in their prized Mustang, and changes its tune to </em><em>the "John Brown’s Body" version of "the Battle Hymn of the Republic”. </em>

<em>N.B.: It also erases the data in their Hypermedia Wonderland database.</em>

<em>Meanwhile, the Southern general launches his own script by setting up a website called “the Best Pieces Ever Published in the Believer Magazine”. Somewhere within the html of the page dedicated to an interview with the philosopher Simon Critchley, the South launches its own hidden JavaScript instructing all the IOT devices in the Yankee’s home to coordinate a musically distributed version of “Dixie” in a top volume loop that can only be stopped by a genuine 21 gun salute pointed at the computer. The best part is, the Southern general used Hypermedia Wonderland to organize and stage this attack. And just like in real life, there are no real winners in this war. Best to use the h method against XSS whenever you can.</em>

<strong>Sanitize Condition Strings</strong>

While we are on the topic of sanitary coding, never put your arguments directly into the condition string when using SQL or Active Record. <a href="http://giphy.com/gifs/gp3tuNQzyWr0A/html5" target="_blank">When I saw this scene </a>in the recent Bourne movie, I was chuckling to myself, because if the CIA can’t sanitize their subset requests in SQL, they deserve whatever is coming to them… I said, jokingly, while joking.

Here is the scrubbed-up version of a “.where” SQL query with arguments from a get route including three highlighted instances of this in HW:
<pre>get '/:pslug/final_map' do
  @highest_votes = []
  @project = Project.find_by_pslug(params[:pslug])
  @oldchunks = Oldchunk.where("project_id = ?", @project.id)
  #more code here...
</pre>
The “rated P for Pwned” version would be:
<pre>Oldchunk.where("project_id = #{@project.id}")</pre>
Def avoid this version, unless you want to work in the writers room for the <em>Bourne</em> franchise.
<pre>  #this is code contd. from above:

  @oldchunks.each do |oldchunk|
    puts oldchunk.title
    newchunks = Newchunk.where("oldchunk_id = ?", oldchunk.id)
    puts newchunks
    if newchunks.size == 0
      @highest_votes << Newchunk.new(title: "there is no vote data for this section")
      puts "there isn't any data for this section yet."
    else
      likes_array = newchunks.collect do | newchunk|
        Like.where("newchunk_id = ?", newchunk.id).size
      end
      @highest_votes << newchunks[likes_array.each_with_index.max[1]]
    end
  end
  erb :'final_map'
end</pre>
By the way, I always store naked photos in a file marked “Black Operations”, so if Julia Stiles hacks my data, she's in for a real treat.

<strong>Here’s a Handy Slug Method I Found On Stack Overflow:</strong>
<pre>#this one turns the title into part of a URL using regex
#Why make your own when there are already cans on the shelf?
def oslug
   title.strip.downcase.gsub(/(&|&)/, ' and ').gsub(/[\s\.\/\\]/, '-').gsub(/[^\w-]/, '').gsub(/[-_]{2,}/, '-').gsub(/^[-_]/, '').gsub(/[-_]$/, '')
end</pre>
<strong>Future Features</strong>

I'd like to restrict who can join projects. I'd also like to make an admin key for the person who enters the first scenes, so that no one else can edit those parts once they are laid down, except the admin. One should be able to delete a whole project. (it would be cool in the final project if everyone who collaborated would have to agree to delete the whole project, but for now, I'd just like to delete it from the admin. account. Score arrangement at will would be helpful. I’d also like to see the original entry when adding a development on that scene.

<strong>Some Artists Who Could Have Used This </strong>

All forms of improvisational performance are already flexible, and often use hidden structures and frameworks upon which to improvise. But these artists really set out to sail off the side of the earth with it. In most cases, I picture their process of composition involving lots of little sheets of paper stuffed in cases and pockets, then taped on a wall, then with coffee spills, then maybe going through a full wash cycle. (I've been there myself)

I think that book was reaching for a new format to appear in. He was already creating digital literature in concept, but using print on paper <a href="http://corriebaldauf.com/section/396998-Infinite-Jest-Project.html" target="_blank">displayed the recursive volume that form could handle. </a>Within the story itself, he developed a kind of inherently weaponized "platform", a dangerously absorbing MacGuffin-villain-multi-media-object  called <em>Infinite Jest</em> . It was the motivic tool he used to evoke addiction's opposition to art.

HW would have helped Cortazar keep track of the episodes, and observe multiple mixes as he wrote. The ease of that process might have encouraged him to weave still more dimension into the reader's choices.

And then there are the graphic scores of composers like Earle Brown and performance pieces by members of Fluxus

Please leave a note for me if there is a feature you'd like your storytelling to have access to, and I'll do my best to incorporate it into Hypermedia Wonderland.

<strong>Possible Use Cases for Hypermedia Wonderland’s Wonky Prototype Build:</strong>

• Sonic Smithy-style band collaboration on a show/rehearsal/performance schedule • writing  a blog post with multi-media illustrations • taking a piece of existing literature in whatever format (musical score, writing, audio, film, recipe, map, etc.) and creating new layers as an individual writer, or as a group of collaborators, then creating an array of options or a choose-your-own option pathway for experiencing it/curating an experience with it • organizing ideas for a live event merged with improv-media, audience participation, and commentary in real time (will need some new features for performance) •  a way for a team to collaborate and vote up a particular design object • the creation of a new translation by a team of writers/speakers • the creation of an audio book read in different voices or languages (need new features for that) • creation of new ideas and features for this platform itself • a new way of teaching something hard to teach by allowing for many layers of margin comments and multi-media for different kinds of learners •  a project for a class studying a particular work—each student taking a different section to write/compose/film/talk about • a platform for interviewing not in real time, but at the interviewer’s convenience—using multimedia, and allowing for the kind of conversation that could happen in real time, but just more like an expanded temporal place that allows for a bit more thinking on the part of the asker and answerer, so as to accommodate schedules while still getting at depth, etc.
